=====================

The MediaMVP Media Center (mvpmc) is an audio/video player for
the Hauppauge MediaMVP.


Prerequisites
-------------

In order to build mvpmc, you will need to make sure you have the
following installed on your system:

	- scons (http://www.scons.org/)


Building
--------

To build a new dongle.bin.mvpmc file, which you can boot on your
MediaMVP via DHCP, use the following command:

	$ make mvp


To build a new mvpmc binary which you can run on your host system,
use the following command:

	$ make host


To build a new linux kernel, use the following command:

	$ make kernel


To build the toolchains needed to build binaries for the MediaMVP,
you will need to create a writeable "/opt/crosstool" directory on
your build system.

To build the uclibc cross-compiler (needed for userland binaries):

	$ ( cd tools/toolchains/uclibc ; ./mvpmc-uclibc.sh )

To build the glibc cross-compiler (needed for recompiling the kernel):

	$ ( cd tools/toolchains/glibc ; ./mvpmc-glibc.sh )


To build source code HTML documentation with doxygen, use the following
command:
