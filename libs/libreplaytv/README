ReplayTV Client Interface Library (replaytvlib) Readme
------------------------------------------------------
John Honeycutt (honeycut@sourceforge.net) 10/04/2004

General
-------
This is replaytvlib, a C library for communicating with ReplayTV 4XXX & 5XXX series 
PVR's. i.e. obtaining show guide information, streaming video, etc...
Much of it is based on the replaypc-0.4.0 source code. http://replaypc.sourceforge.net/
Where replaypc is a commandline driven toolset, replaytvlib is intended to be a library
which is linked by applications desiring to communicate with ReplayTV devices.
The initial user of replaytvlib is MediaMVP. http://www.mvpmc.org/

Some great replaytv resources are:
  The ReplayTV FAQ page: http://www.replayfaqs.com/
  molehill:              http://www.molehill.org/twiki/bin/view/Replay/WebHome
     The molehill site contains tons-o protocol information on replaytv lan video sharing.
  
Library API
------------
The library's api header is: rtvlib.h
All public structure types and api fuctions are exported through this header.

Usage
-----
-Just link libreplaytv.a to the application.
*******WARNING*********
 Make sure the applications system time is within 40 seconds of the 
 replaytv device's time or the replaytv device will refuse to communicate.

Dependencies
------------
Currently the only external dependency is expat which is used for XML parsing.
http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Debugging Shell
---------------
The library build also generates the 'rtv_shell' executable.
This is a debug program that allows exercising the library's API's. 
e.g: obtaining & and displaying a replaytv's device information, 
     obtaining and displaying a replay guide snapshot, etc...

mvpmc
-----
mvpmc interfaces to replaytvlib from mvpmc/src/replaytv.c

Library Development
-------------------

Status
------
09/20/2004:
- rtv_get_device_info() api fully functional
  Also parses the SW version string to generate major, minor, & build keys. 
- rtv_get_guide_snapshot() api returns partial guide information for 5K series devices.
- api's for formatting & printing device information and guide snapshot data. 
- api's for freeing device info & guide snapshot structure memory.
- api's for setting/getting library debug flags.
- raw httpfs access functions exported. (Need create targeted api's and quit exporting these)
- rtv_shell debug executable fully functional
09/28/2004:
-Added httpfs api's to get dir listings, get file status, get volume info.
-Added api for reading a httpfs file.
-Added rtv_shell debug command 'fsget' to copy a httpfs file to local disk.
-Added rtv_shell commands to get volume info, get file status, & list a directory
09/29/2004:
-Got medium res & highres shows streaming properly.
 Added parm to hc_read_pieces to specify how many 32K chunks to merge before calling callback fxn.
 (The mvpmc demuxer likes 128K chunks better than 32K chunks)
-Added nc_open() socket option to set SORCVBUF to 4K. This is needed to get the mvp to ack 
 packets in a timely manner so the RTV doesn't back off an starve the demuxer.
 Note: I haven't been able to get a RTV5K streaming to the mvp to set a tcp window greater than 
       8K. (This is why it needs timely ACK's) DVArchive sets a 64K window. Snooping two RTV5K's 
       streaming shows 32K tcp windows.
-Added new API to allow rerouting RTV_PRT's to a file instead of stdout. 
10/04/2004:
-Cleanud up much of the library's error checking.
-Added ability to redirect RTV_PRT statements to a file
-Added initial mvpmc gui support for multiple RTV's
-Added mvpmc command line options for setting rtv debug mask & sending logs to a file.
11/04/2004:
-Added discovery (SSDP). i.e. Autodiscover replaytv devices instead of passing 
 ipaddr at application command line.
-Got DVArchive to send a 5K guide instead of an XML formatted guide.
 (Needed to implement ssdp and a bogus RTV server to make DVArchive think it is talking to another DVArchive)
11/11/2004:
-Added ability to put rtvlib server to put DVArchive into 4K mode (RTV guide version 3.1).
-Got RTV 4K guide parsing working.
11/15/2004:
-Finished guide parsing. (Atleast everything I care about)
12/29/2004:
-Added ndx file support.
01/23/2005:
-Added support for deleting a show.
-Added support for getting current play position.
05/15/2005:
-Added commercial skip support.
-Created rtvmpegtool for parsing replaytv 5K mpeg files, parsing ndx, files, & parsing evt files.

Library TODO
------------
-Set up autoconf and get rid of Makefile
-Cleanup internal header files
