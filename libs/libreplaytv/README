ReplayTV Client Interface Library (replaytvlib) Readme
------------------------------------------------------
John Honeycutt (honeycut@nc.rr.com) 09/20/2004

General
-------
This is replaytvlib, a C library for communicating with ReplayTV 4XXX & 5XXX series 
PVR's. i.e. obtaining show guide information, streaming video, etc...
It is based on the replaypc-0.4.0 source code. http://replaypc.sourceforge.net/
Where replaypc is a commandline driven toolset, replaytvlib is intended to be a library
which is linked by applications desiring to communicate with ReplayTV devices.
The initial user of replaytvlib is MediaMVP. http://mvpmc.sourceforge.net/

Some great replaytv resources are:
  The ReplayTV FAQ page: http://www.replayfaqs.com/
  molehill:              http://www.molehill.org/twiki/bin/view/Replay/WebHome
     The molehill site contains tons-o protocol information on replaytv lan video sharing.
  
Library API
------------
The library's api header is: rtvlib.h
All public structure types and api fuctions are exported through this header.

Usage
-----
-Just link libreplaytv.a to the application.
 WARNING: Make sure the applications system time is within 40 seconds of the 
          replaytv device's time or the replaytv device will refuse to communicate.

Dependencies
------------
Currently the only external dependency is expat which is used for XML parsing.
http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Debugging Shell
---------------
The library build also generates the 'rtv_shell' executable.
This is a debug program that allows exercising the library's. 
e.g: obtaining & and displaying a replaytv's device information, 
     obtaining and displaying a replay guide snapshot, etc...

mvpmc
-----
mvpmc interfaces to replaytvlib from mvpmc/src/replaytv.c

Library Development
-------------------
There's still lots to do. If you want to help, great!

Status
------
09/20/2004:
- rtv_get_device_info() api fully functional
  Also parses the SW version string to generate major, minor, & build keys. 
- rtv_get_guide_snapshot() api returns partial guide information for 5K series devices.
- api's for formatting & printing device information and guide snapshot data. 
- api's for freeing device info & guide snapshot structure memory.
- api's for setting/getting library debug flags.
- raw httpfs access functions exported. (Need create targeted api's and quit exporting these)
- rtv_shell debug executable fully functional

Library TODO
------------
-Set up autoconf and get rid of Makefile
-Cleanup internal header files
-Added ability & api to re-direct RTV_PRT statements to a file.
-Finish 5K Guide parsing and string formatting routines.
-Add 4K Guide parsing
-Figure out how to get DVArchive to send a 5K guide instead of an XML formatted guide.
 (I know this can be done because I've snooped DVArchive communicating w/ my RTV5K)
-Maybe remove the expat lib dependency. It's only used for rtv_get_device_info() response 
 parsing.
-Cleanup error checking. Current code is inconsistent. Can hang under some conditions, etc...
-Create httpfs api's. rtv_fsget_dir_list(), rtv_fsget_vol_info(), rtv_fsget_filestat().
-Get copying a file from replayTV to local or NFS working.
-Add rtv_get_device_info() check to compare replaytv device's time to application platform's
 time. Spew error message if greater than 30 second difference.
-Add replay unit discovery (SSDP). i.e. Autodiscover replaytv devices instead of passing 
 ipaddr at application command line.
-Add support for deleting a show.
-Add support for the replay show ".ndx" files to allow jumping
 around the show by timestamp.
-Add commercial skip support.
 
mvpmv TODO
----------
-Add support for multiple replaytv devices
-Add support to display replay device 'friendly name', Den, Bedroom, etc...
-Add support for displaying the show synopsys, actors, recorded
 date/time, etc...
-Add commandline option for setting library debug flags and re-dirrecting library 
 RTV_PRT statements to a file.
